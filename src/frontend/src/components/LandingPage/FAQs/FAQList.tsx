    question:
      "What is Battlechan, and how is it different from traditional social media platforms?",
    ans: "Battlechan is a decentralized social media platform that prioritizes free speech, privacy, and community-driven content moderation. Unlike traditional platforms, Battlechan empowers users to manage content through a tokenized time-based system, where upvotes and downvotes directly impact a post's visibility and rewards. It uses blockchain technology to prevent bots and spam while offering transparent rewards for valuable contributions.",

    question: "How does the time-based system work for posts?",
    ans: "When you create a post on Battlechan, it starts with a five-minute countdown timer, equivalent to 5 $TIME tokens. Each upvote adds one minute to the timer, while downvotes reduce the timer by a minute. If the timer reaches zero, the post is archived. Upvotes beyond the initial five minutes can be withdrawn by the original poster as $TIME tokens.",

    question:
      "What happens to my upvotes and downvotes when I withdraw my $TIME tokens?",
    ans: "When you decide to withdraw your accumulated $TIME tokens, 25% is distributed to all commenters with five or more upvotes on your post, while you keep the remaining 75%. However, if you don't withdraw and your post is archived due to the timer reaching zero, no rewards will be distributed to commenters.",

    question: "How are downvotes handled in the system?",
    ans: "When a user downvotes a post, 50% of the $TIME tokens used are burned to manage inflation, while the other 50% goes to the team wallet to cover costs related to maintaining the dApp. This helps cover development costs and maintain the platform's sustainability. After transitioning to a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), these funds will go to the DAO treasury.",
